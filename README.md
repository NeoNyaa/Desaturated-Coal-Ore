# Desaturated Coal Ore
A simple tweak to the coal ore texture which removes the green tint introduced in MC version 1.13.

## More information
Mojang did a complete overhaul of the Minecraft textures in MC version 1.13, and this includes the coal ore. Since the 1.13 update, coal has had a slight tint of green to it which looks out of place. This resource pack removes ALL the saturation of the texture to make it colorless.

## Comparison
Below is an image showing the coal ore texture before and after being having its saturation removed.
